# ppmview
A Portable Pix Map viewer for CPM MBASIC using FabGL serial terminal.

PPMVIEW will allow you to view 64 Color, ASCII .PPM pictures on CP/M using the FabGL Ansi Terminal.
GIMP is recommended for converting files.  Images do not need to be reduced in color, as the Ansi Terminal
will do this automatically.   The FabGL Ansi terminal should be set in 512x384, 64 Color mode.

Communication errors will be displayed as numbers in the upper left corner depending on the stability of your connection.

PPMVIEW is written in Microsoft BASIC MBASIC-80 Rev. 5.21 CP/M Version.
A BASCOM compiled version is also provided.
